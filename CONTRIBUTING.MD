### Communicating with others

Be respectful and don't harass others. No homophobia, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination will be tolerated.

## Naming notations and conventions

- Commit messages use [convetional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  + `add: things added to file`
  + `remove: things removed from file`
  + `refractor: things refractored`
  + `update: things updated`
- CSS variable names use hyphen delimited strings
  + all lowercase and separated by hyphens instead of spaces
  + `Red Box -> red-box`
  + explain what the class name/id do, but without it being too long
- JavaScript variable names use camelCase
  + first letter is lower case and every next word begins with uppercase
  + no spaces
  + `Red Box -> redBox`
  + explain what the variable name does, but without it being too long
