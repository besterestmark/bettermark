## HTML

- Have `<title>` tag for search engine optimization
- Have !DOCTYPE
- No inline js or style

## JS

- Load last to not slow down page (put at end of html)
- Minify and have as less files as possible

## CSS

- Minify and have as less files as possible
- Have multiple stylesheets
  + Lantern (chad)
  + Gruvbox
  + others

## Ideas

- TOC
	+ TOC 1|2|3|4|5|6 for depth of headings shown (Default is TOC6 aka the most)
	+ Syntax maybe `[TOC(1|2|3|4|5|6)]`
  + cool https://github.com/3r3bu5x9/Prismatic-Night#table-of-contents

## Concerns

- Headings
  + match with whitespace before `    :# im an epic chad with a space` // FIXED

## Options

- SHORT_MODE
  + `<blockquote>` vs `<q>` (inline)
  + `<strong>` vs `<b>` (inline)
  + `<em>` vs `<i>` (inline)
  + `<span>` vs `<div>` (FOR SPOILERS)
- option for minified everything (html, css and js if any)
  + option to not use the js libraries (if any)

## TODO

## Warnings

- Whitespace before heading
- Lack of empty line around/after headings
- Duplicating heading
- Lack of space after blockquote [UNLESS ANOTHER BLOCKQUOTE]
